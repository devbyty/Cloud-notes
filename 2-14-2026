# Phase 1 – Harden the Foundation (0–3 Months)

This is Linux + scripting depth.

Not surface-level.

You should be comfortable with:

Linux:

- systemctl
- journalctl
- grep / awk / sed
- permissions
- users/groups
- crontab
- ssh
- networking basics (ss, netstat, ping, traceroute)

Python:

- loops
- functions
- reading files
- basic error handling
- calling system commands
- working with JSON

Goal:

Be able to automate OS-level tasks cleanly.

If you can't automate your own workstation setup,

you’re not ready for cloud scale.

# Phase 2 – AWS Fundamentals (3–6 Months)

No deep wizardry yet.

Master:

- EC2
- IAM
- VPC
- Security Groups
- S3
- CloudWatch
- Basic networking concepts

Build small labs:

- Launch EC2
- Attach IAM role
- Configure security group
- SSH in
- Install NGINX
- Set up CloudWatch alarm

Understand what’s happening, not just clicking.

---

# Phase 3 – Terraform Layer (6–8 Months)

Now introduce Terraform.

Start with:

- Provision EC2
- Create VPC + subnets
- Create IAM roles
- Create S3 bucket

Understand:

- State files
- Plan vs apply
- Idempotency
- Modules
- Variables

You’re not memorizing syntax.

You’re learning infrastructure thinking.

# Phase 4 – Automation Layer (8–12 Months)

Now bring in boto3 + automation.

Examples:

- Script to find unused EBS volumes
- Script to stop instances with no traffic
- Script to rotate IAM keys
- Script to tag all untagged resources
- Generate simple compliance report

Now you understand:

Terraform builds.

Python operates.
