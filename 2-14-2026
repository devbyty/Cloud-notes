# Phase 1 – Harden the Foundation (0–3 Months)

This is Linux + scripting depth.

Not surface-level.

You should be comfortable with:

Linux:

- systemctl
- journalctl
- grep / awk / sed
- permissions
- users/groups
- crontab
- ssh
- networking basics (ss, netstat, ping, traceroute)

Python:

- loops
- functions
- reading files
- basic error handling
- calling system commands
- working with JSON

Goal:

Be able to automate OS-level tasks cleanly.

If you can't automate your own workstation setup,

you’re not ready for cloud scale.

# Phase 2 – AWS Fundamentals (3–6 Months)

No deep wizardry yet.

Master:

- EC2
- IAM
- VPC
- Security Groups
- S3
- CloudWatch
- Basic networking concepts

Build small labs:

- Launch EC2
- Attach IAM role
- Configure security group
- SSH in
- Install NGINX
- Set up CloudWatch alarm

Understand what’s happening, not just clicking.

---

# Phase 3 – Terraform Layer (6–8 Months)

Now introduce Terraform.

Start with:

- Provision EC2
- Create VPC + subnets
- Create IAM roles
- Create S3 bucket

Understand:

- State files
- Plan vs apply
- Idempotency
- Modules
- Variables

You’re not memorizing syntax.

You’re learning infrastructure thinking.

---

# Phase 4 – Automation Layer (8–12 Months)

Now bring in boto3 + automation.

Examples:

- Script to find unused EBS volumes
- Script to stop instances with no traffic
- Script to rotate IAM keys
- Script to tag all untagged resources
- Generate simple compliance report

Now you understand:

Terraform builds.

Python operates.

Tier 1 – Process & Service Control (Cloud Core)

If you only learn one category first, make it this.

1. systemctl

Manage services.

systemctl status nginx
systemctl restart nginx
systemctl enable nginx
systemctl disable nginx


Cloud reality:
Instances go down because services crash.
You must be calm here.

2. journalctl

Read logs from systemd services.

journalctl -u nginx
journalctl -xe
journalctl -f


This is how you debug fast.

3. ps / top / htop
ps aux | grep nginx
top


Process visibility = operational awareness.

Tier 2 – Networking (Very Important)

Most cloud interviews touch this.

4. ss (modern netstat)
ss -tulnp


Shows:

Listening ports

What process owns them

5. ping
ping google.com


Basic but foundational.

6. curl

Massively important.

curl http://localhost
curl -I https://example.com


Test web services, APIs, health checks.

7. traceroute
traceroute google.com


Understanding routing paths.

Tier 3 – File & Log Mastery
8. grep
grep "error" /var/log/syslog
grep -i fail auth.log


This is used constantly.

9. tail
tail -f /var/log/syslog


Live log streaming.

10. cat, less, head
less file.txt
head -20 file.txt

Tier 4 – Permissions & Users (Underrated)
11. chmod
chmod 755 script.sh

12. chown
chown user:group file.txt

13. id, whoami
id
whoami


Cloud IAM makes more sense when Linux permissions make sense.

Tier 5 – Disk & System Health
14. df
df -h

15. du
du -sh *

16. free
free -m

Tier 6 – SSH (Cloud Essential)
ssh user@host
scp file.txt user@host:/tmp


Cloud = remote systems.
SSH is oxygen.
