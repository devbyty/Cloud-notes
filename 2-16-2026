	•	API = rules for talking to a system
	•	JSON = data format used in the conversation

Now we zoom into SDK.

⸻

What Is An SDK Really?

SDK = Software Development Kit

That sounds big, but in practice it usually means:

A language-specific toolbox that makes using an API easier.

That’s it.

⸻

Let’s Make It Concrete

Imagine AWS gives you only this:

Documentation that says:

To create an EC2 instance, send an HTTPS POST request to:

https://ec2.amazonaws.com

Include these headers.
Include this cryptographic signature.
Include this JSON body.

You could do it manually in Python using low-level HTTP libraries.

But that would mean:
	•	Building the HTTP request yourself
	•	Generating AWS Signature Version 4
	•	Adding headers correctly
	•	Handling errors manually
	•	Parsing JSON responses manually

That’s a lot.

⸻

What Boto3 Does (The SDK)

Instead, you write:

import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client("ec2")

ec2.run_instances(
    ImageId="ami-123",
    InstanceType="t2.micro",
    MinCount=1,
    MaxCount=1
)

That’s clean.

Behind the scenes, the SDK:
	1.	Builds the HTTPS request
	2.	Signs it with your credentials
	3.	Sends it to AWS
	4.	Receives JSON
	5.	Converts it into Python dictionaries
	6.	Handles errors

You didn’t deal with HTTP directly at all.

⸻

Simple Mental Model

API = The highway rules
HTTPS = The road
JSON = The package being delivered
SDK = Your car with cruise control and automatic steering

You could walk (manual API calls).

Or you could drive (SDK).

⸻

Important Clarification

An SDK is not:
	•	The cloud
	•	The server
	•	The API itself

It is just a helper library for developers.

⸻

Even Simpler Version

API says:

“Here’s how you talk to me.”

SDK says:

“Here, I’ll handle the talking for you.”

⸻

Different Languages Have Different SDKs

AWS provides:
	•	Boto3 (Python)
	•	AWS SDK for Java
	•	AWS SDK for JavaScript
	•	AWS SDK for Go
	•	AWS SDK for .NET

Same API.
Different language tools.

⸻

The Real Unlock

The API is universal.

The SDK is language-specific.

The API doesn’t change.
The SDK depends on what programming language you’re using.
