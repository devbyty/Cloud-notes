	•	API = rules for talking to a system
	•	JSON = data format used in the conversation

Now we zoom into SDK.

⸻

What Is An SDK Really?

SDK = Software Development Kit

That sounds big, but in practice it usually means:

A language-specific toolbox that makes using an API easier.

That’s it.

⸻

Let’s Make It Concrete

Imagine AWS gives you only this:

Documentation that says:

To create an EC2 instance, send an HTTPS POST request to:

https://ec2.amazonaws.com

Include these headers.
Include this cryptographic signature.
Include this JSON body.

You could do it manually in Python using low-level HTTP libraries.

But that would mean:
	•	Building the HTTP request yourself
	•	Generating AWS Signature Version 4
	•	Adding headers correctly
	•	Handling errors manually
	•	Parsing JSON responses manually

That’s a lot.

⸻

What Boto3 Does (The SDK)

Instead, you write:

import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client("ec2")

ec2.run_instances(
    ImageId="ami-123",
    InstanceType="t2.micro",
    MinCount=1,
    MaxCount=1
)

That’s clean.

Behind the scenes, the SDK:
	1.	Builds the HTTPS request
	2.	Signs it with your credentials
	3.	Sends it to AWS
	4.	Receives JSON
	5.	Converts it into Python dictionaries
	6.	Handles errors

You didn’t deal with HTTP directly at all.

⸻

Simple Mental Model

API = The highway rules
HTTPS = The road
JSON = The package being delivered
SDK = Your car with cruise control and automatic steering

You could walk (manual API calls).

Or you could drive (SDK).

⸻

Important Clarification

An SDK is not:
	•	The cloud
	•	The server
	•	The API itself

It is just a helper library for developers.

⸻

Even Simpler Version

API says:

“Here’s how you talk to me.”

SDK says:

“Here, I’ll handle the talking for you.”

⸻

Different Languages Have Different SDKs

AWS provides:
	•	Boto3 (Python)
	•	AWS SDK for Java
	•	AWS SDK for JavaScript
	•	AWS SDK for Go
	•	AWS SDK for .NET

Same API.
Different language tools.

⸻

The Real Unlock

The API is universal.

The SDK is language-specific.

The API doesn’t change.
The SDK depends on what programming language you’re using.

# Cloud Ops / Cloud Infrastructure Pivot Plan

## Goal
Transition from IT support → Cloud Operations / Cloud Infrastructure role.

Core principle:

Cloud Ops = Linux + Networking + Automation + Cloud

AWS is the environment.
Foundations come first.

---

# Phase 1 — Linux Foundation (Weeks 1–2)

## Objective
Be comfortable living inside Linux without fear.

## Core Skills
- SSH usage
- File system navigation (`ls`, `cd`, `pwd`)
- File permissions (`chmod`, `chown`)
- User management (`useradd`, `usermod`)
- Process management (`ps`, `top`, `kill`)
- System services (`systemctl`)
- Logs (`/var/log`, `journalctl`)
- Networking tools (`curl`, `ss`, `ping`)
- Package management (`yum`, `dnf`, `apt`)
- Bash basics (pipes, redirects, variables)

## Weekly Practice Ideas
- Launch EC2 and configure something manually
- Install nginx, break it, fix it
- Create users and restrict permissions
- Monitor processes and kill runaway services

## Outcome
You can debug a Linux server without panic.

---

# Phase 2 — Networking Fundamentals (Weeks 2–3)

## Objective
Understand networking well enough that VPCs make sense.

## Core Concepts
- What is a subnet?
- CIDR notation (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24)
- Public vs private IP
- NAT gateway
- Route tables
- Security groups vs firewalls
- DNS basics
- TCP vs UDP

## Practice
- Draw simple VPC diagrams
- Create security groups and test access
- Restrict SSH by IP
- Explain how a public web server works end-to-end

## Outcome
You can explain how traffic flows through AWS.

---

# Phase 3 — Automation (Weeks 3–4)

## Objective
Automate instead of clicking.

## Python Focus (Not App Dev)
- Variables, loops, conditionals
- Working with JSON
- File I/O
- Basic error handling

## AWS Automation
- boto3 basics
- List S3 buckets
- Launch/describe EC2
- Parse CLI JSON output

## Bash Practice
- Environment variables
- Writing small scripts
- Using pipes with `jq` or `--query`

## Outcome
You can script repetitive tasks confidently.

---

# Phase 4 — Infrastructure as Code (Weeks 4–6)

## Objective
Deploy infrastructure consistently using code.

## Tools to Learn
- AWS SAM
- CloudFormation basics
- (Optional later: Terraform)

## Concepts
- What a template is
- Resources vs properties
- IAM roles inside templates
- Deployment lifecycle

## Practice
- Deploy Lambda via SAM
- Add API Gateway
- Add DynamoDB to template
- Modify and redeploy safely

## Outcome
You understand how real teams deploy cloud infrastructure.

---

# Ongoing: Interview Readiness Layer

After foundations stabilize:

## Be able to explain:
- What is a VPC?
- How does Lambda scale?
- Difference between EC2 and Lambda
- What is least privilege?
- What happens during a cold start?
- How would you deploy 100 servers?

## Build Talking Points
From labs you’ve done:
- EC2 web server
- IAM restricted user
- Lambda cold vs warm start
- SAM deployment
- S3 versioning

---

# Mental Model Summary

Cloud Ops is NOT:
- Memorizing AWS services.

Cloud Ops IS:
- Operating systems
- Networking
- Automation
- Infrastructure reasoning

AWS is just the platform where those skills live.

---

# Recommended Weekly Rhythm

3–4 sessions per week:

- 1 Linux lab
- 1 AWS lab
- 1 Networking or automation drill
- 1 recap / notes consolidation

Consistency > intensity.

---

# Final Note

You are already doing the right things:
- CLI work
- IAM practice
- EC2 hands-on
- Lambda experiments
- Cleanup discipline

That is real CloudOps progression.
